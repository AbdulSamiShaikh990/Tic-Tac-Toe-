# Tic-Tac-Toe-
 Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking squares with their symbols—usually "X" and "O"—with the goal of aligning three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Despite its simplicity, the game requires strategic thinking, as players anticipate their opponent’s moves.
